### Welcome to the Click Box Challenge!
  
This project is a solution to a frontend interview question where the goal is to create a user interface with six boxes.  
The user can click on each box to change its color, and when all boxes are clicked, they return to their original colors in reverse order.  
## Features
- **Interactive Boxes:** Click on any box to change its color.
- **Reset in Reverse Order:** After clicking all six boxes, they will return to their original colors in the reverse order of how they were clicked.

The implementation not only tackles the challenge, but also includes keyboard navigation for better accessibility.
